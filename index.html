<h1>About</h1>
<!-- <span class ="keyword"></span> -->
<p>My name is Angela Godfriedovna A. Twum and I am a <span class="keyword">junior astrophysicist</span> from Ghana, West Africa. </p>
<p>I received my BA in Physics from Pomona College, CA in 2018 with a focus in Astrophysics. </p>
<p>In my research, I use computational and statistical methods to answer astrophysical questions pertaining to <span class ="keyword">galaxy evolution</span>, <span class ="keyword">tidal disruption events</span> and <span class ="keyword">black holes</span>. </p>
<p>Additionally, I have strong thirst for knowledge and a <span class ="keyword">personal interest</span> in the <span class ="keyword">status of astronomy</span> and <span class ="keyword">technological development</span> in Ghana and Africa. 
</p>
<p>I consider myself a curious scientist, artist, amateur programmer and life-long learner.</p>
<p>My interests include computer science, history, physiology, astrobiology, astrochemistry, latin dance, psychology, technology, art and design. </p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy engaging in activities that allow me to <span class ="keyword">learn</span> and be <span class ="keyword">creative</span>. I make time to teach myself new coding skills that add to my programming tool box and find <span class ="keyword">value</span> in self expression through art, music, and writing. 
</p>
<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you want to work together on something or have questions regarding my research. I am always <span class ="keyword">excited</span> to talk about all things cosmos related and believe that the only way to truly understand something is to <span class ="keyword">teach</span> it. </p>
